        <p class="box">It is the highest waterfall in the world at 979 meters high. This waterfall is generated from the Auyantepui River, it is called the Angel Falls by a Venezuelan in honor of Jimmie Angel who was an American aviator who discovered this wonder in 1937.Despite the fact that this jump is one of the biggest tourist attractions in the country, its visit is complicated, since the trip to the falls is not easy. As the area where it is located is surrounded by forest, the only way to access it is by taking a plane flight from the country's capital or from Ciudad Bol√≠var, to reach a Canaima camp.
