According to the  folklore of indigenous people  of the gran sabana, mount roraima is a part of the legendary tree that once held  all of the fruits and vegetables in all the world. For them, the mount is the mother of everything and what gives us life. This peak was first discovered in 1596 by Sir Walter Raleigh, who was in charge of a journey to Guyana in search of El Dorado.
