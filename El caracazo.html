            On February 27, 1989, a wave of protests began on the outskirts of Caracas that later spread throughout Venezuela and generated great disturbances and this generated around 276 deaths in the protests.And also a deep malaise in which many saw one of the reasons for the appearance on the political scene of Commander Hugo Ch√°vez, who in 1992 would lead a military attempt to seize power and, finally, in 1998, was elected president.
It also had to do with the fall of the economy in the 70s, Venezuela got into a lot of debt and could not pay those large amounts of money, years passed and Venezuela still had the same economic problems and that caused the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency and that caused the caracazo.
