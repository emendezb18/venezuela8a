            After Chavez died, Nicolas Maduro was elected as president of Venezuela in 2013. As the year progressed, growth of the Venezuelan economy slowed to a crawl, inflation climbed above 50 percent, and things  such as toilet paper, milk, and flour became increasingly difficult to obtain. Maduro made everything worse and he demonstrated what a corrupt president is. With Maduro, people are starving, looking for jobs is very hard, and there are no jobs that are affordable there. Since 2017, Venezuela has reached 90 % of poverty. Water and electricity are services that are not affordable anymore also because of inflation. Even newspapers say that people were taking water from the streets for cooking, bathing and drinking. Kids were not less affected than adults, some kids couldn’t even afford going to school because of the lack of basic needs like transportation and all mentioned before. All of this led to a big series of protests that maduro just ignored.  Maduro didn’t care at all for his country, opposite of Chavez that at least cared for the poor people. Millions of people had to leave the country to seek better opportunities and a job.
