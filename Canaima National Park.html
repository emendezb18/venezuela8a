        <p class="box">Located in the south east, we are going to find the legendary Canaima national park. It was first established as a National Park in 1962 and was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. When it was designated by the Venezuelan government as a national park in 1962, it had an area of one million hectares. The increase to 3 million hectares in 1975 made it one of the largest national parks in the world.This park contains many  beautiful geographical features, here we can find the biggest Waterfall in the world, Angel Falls . This Park  protects the headwaters of the Caroní River, which supplies Guri, Venezuela’s largest hydroelectric power station providing around 70% of the country's electricity. This national park is a really famous tourist attraction in South America because of its diversity in rivers, woods and savannas. The only way to get to Canaima is by air, you can have a flight to Caracas and then enter to the occidental sector and reach the village of Canaima.
